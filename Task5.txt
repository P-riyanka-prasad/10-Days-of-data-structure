Remove Duplicates
Challenge yourself with an exercise in which you’ll have to remove duplicates from a doubly linked list.
Problem
In this exercise, you are required to remove the duplicates from a doubly linked list.


In the exercise widget, the delete_node method has been given to you. It is a slight modification of the delete method we covered in one of the previous lessons. You have to figure out the modification yourself. The hint is to recall the remove_duplicates lesson from one of the previous chapters.
Coding Time!
In the code below, the remove_duplicates is a class method of the DoublyLinkedList class. You cannot see the rest of the code as it is hidden. As remove_duplicates is a class method, please make sure that you don’t change the indentation of the code provided to you. You are required to write your solution under the method prototype.
For this exercise, you are not required to return anything. Just remove the duplicates from the linked list using the delete_node method.
