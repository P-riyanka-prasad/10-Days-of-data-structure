Problem
In this exercise, you are required to determine whether a given linked list is a circular linked list or not. Your solution should 
return True or False to indicate if the linked list that was passed in to the method is circular or not.




Coding Time!
In the code below, the is_circular_linked_list is a class method of the CircularLinkedList class. You cannot see the rest 
of the code as it is hidden. As is_circular_linked_list is a class method, please make sure that you donâ€™t change 
the indentation of the code provided to you. You are required to write your solution under the method prototype.
For this exercise, you are required to return either True or False based on whether input_list is circular or not. In the test cases,
the ellipses (...) are used to depict circular linked lists which means that they represent that the next node in the linked list
is the head node.
