Problem
You are required to check and determine whether a tree satisfies the BST property. First of all, let’s define the BST property.
BST Property
The BST property states that every node on the right subtree has to be larger than the current node, and every node on the left
subtree has to be smaller than the current node.
The binary search tree property (BST property) is a global property that every binary search tree must satisfy.
Below are some examples that show which trees satisfy the BST property:

Here are some other examples where we check for the BST property:






Coding Time!
In the code below, is_bst_satisfied is a class method of the BST class. You cannot see the rest of the code as it is hidden. 
As is_bst_satisfied is a class method, please make sure that you don’t change the indentation of the code provided to you. 
You are required to write your solution under the method prototype and return True or False from the method.
