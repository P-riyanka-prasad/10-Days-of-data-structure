Task 1 : — — — — — → Below
Begin by creating a new class, Node. Add an .__init__() method in the Node class that takes a value and an optional link_node (default should be None). These should be saved to the corresponding self properties (self.value and self.link_node).
Nodes Python Getters
We need methods to access the data and link within the node. For this, we will use two getters, .get_value() and .get_link_node().
These should each return their corresponding value on the self object.
Task 2 — — — — — — — →
2. Implement the .get_value() getter in the Node class.
Task 3 — — — — — —— ->
3. Implement the .get_link_node() getter in the Node class.
Nodes Python Setter
We are only allowing the value of the node to be set upon creation. However, we want to allow updating the link of the node. For this, we will use a setter to modify the self.link_node attribute.
The method should be called .set_link_node() and should take link_node as an argument. It should then update the self.link_node attribute as appropriate.
Task 4 — — — — — →
4. Implement the .set_link_node() setter in the Node class.

Task Final — — — — →
Outside of Node, instantiate three nodes. None have an argument for link_node:
the first has a value of "likes to yak" and be assigned to a variable yacko
the second has a value of "has a penchant for hoarding snacks" and be assigned to wacko
the third has a value of "enjoys spending time in movie lots" and be assigned to dot
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — -
2. Now let’s give these nodes some responsibilities! yacko can keep track of dot and dot can keep up with wacko. wacko can’t keep track of anything though.
Below the newly created nodes, use your .set_link_node() method to give:
yacko a link_node of dot
dot a link_node of wacko
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — -
3. Create two new variables, dots_data, and wackos_data. Use both getter methods to get dot‘s value from yacko and get wacko‘s value from dot. Print dots_data and wackos_data to the console to see the results!
When your code is passing, take a moment to consider:
How would you get yacko‘s value?
How could you get from yacko to wacko‘s value?
How do you think nodes could be helpful for keeping track of and storing information?
